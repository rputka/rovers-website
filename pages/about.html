                        <p>We are students, military veterans, doctors, lawyers, firefighters, engineers, tradesmen, and businessmenâ€¦. The Cleveland Rovers Rugby Football Club is made up of people from of all walks of life, yet brought together by similar motivations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Deeply entrenched in the history of the City of Cleveland, with many of the founders' lineages rooted to Ireland and England, the club is rich in the traditions of team, community, and camaraderie.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a USA Rugby affiliated club, our men's teams compete nationally and internationally year-round in 15s and 7s, while the boys and girls high school 15s sides compete in national tournaments outside of regular school seasons. With a dedicated coaching staff and players ranging in rugby experience, the club and its present members are committed to upholding the traditions of the past, while serving the community and enjoying the game we love.</p>
